You may begin inspecting the AUSSocial App from any page. 
However, the Home page (home.html) is the most suitable to begin with.

The home page is App's feed, and is perhaps the most essential part, think of the Facebook/Instagram "feed".

The search bar currently runs on dummy data, it will allow for the user to find and view other profiles

Announcements is a page dedicated to relevant novel information, similar to the "news" section on Engage.aus.edu. 
Note: when backend is implemented, it will be done so that only specific users (admins/staff) can create announcements

Create is what allows for the preparation and posting of events, announcements, inquiries, and more

The Map is an interactive way of viewing events all over campus

The profile page is the user's personal section of the app. Try editing the bio, playing around with the profile picture as well as the save feature
The profile also allows the user (and other users, once backend is implemented) to view previous personal posts

Everyone in the group worked on at least a small part of every page. 
However, below is a broad overview of who did what, with any additional needed details specified in comment form

Html and their respective css:
announcements.html - Karim
create.html - Karim and Ahmed
home.html - Ahmed
map.html - Chihab
profile.html - Chihab

Implementations (html and JS):
Sign up - Chihab
Navigation bars - Chihab, Karim assisted
Search bar - Chihab
Responsiveness (sm, md, lg) was a group effort, everyone was responsible for their own page's responsiveness, however 
Karim assisted in all pages. This task primarily relied on bootstrap

Javascript implementation was split accordingly
